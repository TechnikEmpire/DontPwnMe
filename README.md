# DontPwnMe

An experiment to see if windows Kernel events are speedy/sufficient enough to protect a directory against malicious attack. Note that presently, the ProcessPunisher application will absolutely murder any process that tries to do anythig with the directory it is protecting (or anything therein), so be prepared to log out and back in to fix the issues that is going to cause. Not responsible in any way if this breaks anything, use at own risk, etc.
